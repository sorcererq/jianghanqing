abstract="Based on the newly appeared image editing and image pro- cessing techniques, a novel interactive, computer-assisted system is proposed for facial synthesis. This paper presents the architecture of this facial synthesis system and gives a detailed description of the four key modules. The techniques used in these modules are also particularized. First, graph cut algorithm is used to automatically select region. Then gradient domain fusion is used to get better result. Finally, k-means method is used to improve efficiency. The experimental results show that our experimental facial synthesis system can produce visually good synthesized face images.",
